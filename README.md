**Web Development Project (theme park website)**

Purpose

There are many reasons why a theme park operator would want a website. Here is a list:

➔ Advertising for the theme park itself so that people who have heard of the park can have a place to look

for information. Can also generate interest for the theme park itself by showing the many different

attractions which could increase sales for both tickets, merchandise and other avenues.

➔ Online booking can simplify ticket purchasing and hotel reservation which can increase sales due to

having a new revenue stream.Online shop can boost sales

➔ Information such as parking hours, parking fees, directions and contact information can be displayed on

the website

➔ For stakeholders such as investors, employees, and suppliers, a website can provide information about

the theme park’s financial performance, employment opportunities, and procurement processes. This can

help stakeholders make informed decisions and engage with the theme park in a more meaningful way.

From the data of the websites, we can see what are the criteria that causes better conversion rate when it comes

to users actually deciding to buy tickets. We do this by looking at the average duration and bounce, longer

duration and low bounce rate indicates user retention and vice versa.. From these sites we can see what

features are common in the websites with higher user retention as compared to sites with lower user retention

and would then be able to implement the positive features and disregard the negative ones.

**Identification of appropriate content for the web site**

Firstly, we analysed various features present on real amusement park websites. These websites typically include

appealing pictures that showcase the park and provide relevant information. Based on this, we developed three

main pages for our website: the homepage, booking page, and information page.

On the homepage, we prominently display captivating photos of the park to entice users to visit. Additionally, we

have included a navigation bar at the top, which consists of options such as booking (to purchase tickets),

explore, a search bar, and a login button. This navigation bar is consistent across all pages of our website.

The booking page is designed to facilitate the ticket reservation process. It features a booking chart that outlines

the different ticket types available. Since amusement parks often have separate pricing for adults and children,

we have incorporated distinct pricing options accordingly. Furthermore, visitors are required to select a specific

date for their ticket reservation. To simplify this process, we have included an interactive calendar within the

booking chart.

The information page serves as a resource for visitors. It showcases ongoing events within the park and includes

a map indicating the locations of various facilities. This interactive map enhances user convenience, allowing

them to easily access information about specific facilities by clicking on them.

Our primary focus in designing the website was to ensure easy access to information and minimse user effort

when seeking essential details.

**Identification of appropriate structure for the web site**

Once we finalised the decision to create three pages for our website, we drew wireframes for each page. During

our research, we visited popular amusement park websites like Universal Studio and Disneyland. At these

websites, the images played a crucial role in giving users an idea of what the parks look like.

Consequently, we utilized captivating photos on the homepage to effectively convey the essence of our park.

Recognising the significance of this page, we placed the photos prominently at the top center. The objective was

to capture users' attention and generate interest in visiting the park.

On the booking page, we prioritised providing information on prices and facility details, as this page serves the

primary function of ticket reservations. To facilitate the booking process, we incorporated an interactive calendar

that enables users to easily select their desired dates. Additionally, at the bottom of the page, we included two

event pictures to ensure that even visitors who had not visited the information page would be aware of ongoing

events.

The information page primarily focuses on providing comprehensive details about the park. To achieve this, we

placed two main events at the top of the page. Furthermore, we designed a central map that allows visitors to

explore different facilities. Clicking on specific locations on the map directs users to corresponding facility

information. We tried to make our site user-friendly and simplify the process of accessing information.

Throughout all pages, we put a navigation bar at the top, ensuring that users can easily access the ticket

reservation from any page.
